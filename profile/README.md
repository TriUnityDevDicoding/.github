## About Our Product
Many students in Indonesia are still confused about choosing a suitable major according to their interests when they want to enter college. In fact, choosing an educational path that suits your interests and talents is the key to getting satisfaction and success in building a career in the future. According to Irene Guntur, an educational psychologist from Integrity Development Flexibility (IDF), as many as 87% of students feel they have chosen the wrong major [[1]](https://puslapdik.kemdikbud.go.id/siap-siap-kuliah-jangan-salah-memilih-program-studi/#:~:text=Beberapa%20waktu%20lalu%2C%20ahli%20Educational,salah%20jurusan%20dengan%20berbagai%20alasan.). Often, the cause of this problem is because there are too many external factors that influence a student's decision in choosing a major, such as too much advice, parental coercion, following a friend's choice of major, and others. Therefore, the RIASEC test is needed to determine the interests and talents of a student in deciding his major before entering the world of lectures.

RIASEC (Realistic[R], Investigative[I], Artistic[A], Social[S], Enterprising[E], Conventional[C]) is a type of psychological test that aims to help someone to estimate interests and talents in learning and even careers according to their personality [[2]](https://www.halodoc.com/artikel/mengenal-lebih-dekat-6-jenis-kepribadian-riasec-1). Another name for this test is the Holland test, which is taken from the figure who developed the RIASEC psychological test, John Holland from the United States in 1959. The results of this test are then used to make personality-career and personality-major matches which can increase job satisfaction and performance and even academic success [[3]](https://www.careerkey.org/fit/personality/holland-code-assessment-riasec).

Based on the problems and descriptions above, we took the initiative to develop a website-based RIASEC test system called RiasecApp. RiasecApp was developed with the intention of contributing to the transformation of technology to support education in Indonesia in order to achieve a golden Indonesia 2045. With RiasecApp, it is expected that students who want to determine their majors can recognize their potential, interests and talents further so that they can minimize the problem of incompatibility with the college majors to be chosen.
